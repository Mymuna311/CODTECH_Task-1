Project: Sentiment Analysis on Hotel Reviews

Overview of the Project:

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. It is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP) with applications in various domains, including customer feedback analysis, product reviews, and social media monitoring. In this project, we analyze hotel reviews to classify them as "Good" or "Bad" based on their content using a deep learning approach.

To achieve this, I have implemented a Dense Neural Network(DNN) model, a type of deep learning architecture, capable of learning complex patterns in data. The model is trained on a dataset of hotel reviews, utilizing embeddings generated by the Universal Sentence Encoder to capture the semantic meaning of the text. The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score, to ensure it accurately reflects customer sentiments.

Objectives:
 
• To preprocess and analyze a large dataset of hotel reviews.
• To implement a deep learning model for sentiment classification.
• To evaluate the model’s performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision recall and ROC-AUC. 
• To visualize the results and derive meaningful insights.

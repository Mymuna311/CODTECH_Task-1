Project: Sentiment Analysis on Hotel Reviews

Overview of the Project:

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. It is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP) with applications in various domains, including customer feedback analysis, product reviews, and social media monitoring. In this project, we analyze hotel reviews to classify them as "Good" or "Bad" based on their content using a deep learning approach.

To achieve this, I have implemented a Dense Neural Network(DNN) model, a type of deep learning architecture, capable of learning complex patterns in data. The model is trained on a dataset of hotel reviews, utilizing embeddings generated by the Universal Sentence Encoder to capture the semantic meaning of the text. The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score, to ensure it accurately reflects customer sentiments.

Objectives:
 
• To preprocess and analyze a large dataset of hotel reviews.
• To implement a deep learning model for sentiment classification.
• To evaluate the model’s performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision recall and ROC-AUC. 
• To visualize the results and derive meaningful insights.

Key Activities:

Data Loading:	CSV file Hotel_Reviews.csv 
Data Preprocessing	- Combined positive and negative reviews into one field
                   - Labeled each review as 'good' or 'bad' based on Reviewer_Score
Exploratory Analysis	- Count of each label visualized
                     - Word clouds for good and bad reviews generated
Balancing Dataset: Equalized good and bad review counts by sampling
Embedding Generation:	Reviews converted to 512-dimensional vectors using USE
Model Building	- Neural network with 2 hidden layers and dropout
               - Trained using categorical_crossentropy loss
Model Evaluation	- Accuracy and loss tracked across epochs
                 - Evaluated on test set
                 - Manual predictions on sample inputs
Prediction & Testing: 	Printed raw review text, actual label, predicted probabilities, and final class label
